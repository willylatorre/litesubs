## FAQ

### **What is LiteSubs?**

LiteSubs lets you sell **credits instead of traditional subscriptions**.
Customers buy credits, you assign them to a person, and credits are used only when needed.

---

### **What are credits?**

Credits are a simple unit of access you define.
They can represent anything: sessions, messages, minutes, actions, or usage.

You decide:

* how and when credits are consumed

---

### **Can I sell credits one-time or recurring?**

Yes.

You can offer:

From the user’s point of view, it’s always just **credits**.

Not really — and that’s the point.

LiteSubs replaces heavy subscriptions with **lighter, more flexible credits**.
Recurring payments are optional and simply refill credits automatically.

---

### **Who are credits assigned to?**

Credits are assigned to a **specific person** (or customer).
That person can then use credits as needed until they run out.

---

When credits reach zero, usage stops.

You can:

You stay in control.

## One small strategic note (optional)

If you want to be extra crisp, you could add a **closing FAQ item**:
